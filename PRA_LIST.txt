LP1  practical list

1. Design suitable Data structures and implement Pass-I of a two-pass assembler / Macroprocessor

2. Design suitable Data structures and implement Pass-2 of a two-pass assembler / Macroprocessor

3. Write a program to create Dynamic Link Library for any mathematical or matrix or string operation 
   and write an application program to test it.

4. Write a program to simulate CPU Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SJF (Preemptive), 
   Priority (Non-Preemptive) and Round Robin (Preemptive).(Any two of this will be in practical exam)

5. Write a program to simulate Memory placement strategies – best fit, first fit, next fit and 
   worst fit. (Same any two)

6. Write a program to simulate Page replacement algorithm.(Can implement any one of~ FIFO, 
   LRU or Optimal)
